# Web Hooks

Example POST payload (JSON) for the (order) `received` event:

<aside class="danger">
  This is an experimental feature and subject to change. For production applications we highly recommend querying for status via the order end point.
</aside>
<%= partial "includes/api/json_snippets/post_webhook_notification.md" %>

Based on your opt-in preferences for various events, the API will POST back
to the your Web Hook URL. The web hook url and settings are available in your
profile, see the <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/> page.

The `url` (string) must be a valid URL (an API endpoint you host) and the
`enabled` (boolean) setting must be checked.

First login, then visit <https://api.mwwondemand.com/account/user/webhooks> to
edit your Web Hooks (opt-in) preferences.

- The `enabled` checkbox must be `checked` in order to receive POST notifications.
- Check the various events that you would like to receive notifications for.
